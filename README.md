# Cyberpunk Full-Stack Security Portfolio
This repository presents a **fictional portfolio** developed to demonstrate my skills in **full-stack development** with a focus on **frontend**.  
The project was built with a **cyberpunk** aesthetic, using neon colors, glitch effects, and matrix rain animations to convey robustness and innovation.
> Note: Most backend functionalities have been intentionally disabled or simulated. The goal is to highlight professional design, visual architecture, and interactive experience, not the complete implementation of security systems.
